# ansible setup for my machines

Configuration for my Debian linux machines.

First run:

```
user@machine:~/git/github/ansible-setup/ $ ansible-playbook playbooks/laptop-work.yml -KD
```

Next runs:

```
user@machine:~/git/github/ansible-setup/ $ ./run.sh
```

Or even better:

```
user@machine:~$ ansible-setup-run
```
